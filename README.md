# TrafficManagement
CS261 coursework.

# Setup
Dependencies you'll need installed. This is OS-dependent so I won't be able to help you here. You'll need:
- Dotnet SDK 9.0
- Unity 6


# General housekeeping
All work should go inside of Assets.

## Conventional git
If you have any questions or problems, please ask!!!
Following [this guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) do. Generally, commit messages should be of the form:
```
feat(login): implemented database linkage to application frontend
```
Where you have the type of commit, followed by what part of the app you changed in brackets, and a detailed message indicating what exactly was changed.

Pushing to main wont be possible, so you'll need to **CREATE A NEW BRANCH FOR YOUR WORK BEFORE YOU START WORKING**. Otherwise you will have a headache of a time solving. This is a warning!!!

Publish your branch to the GitHub and create a __pull request__ when ready to get work reviewed. We'll then merge to main and continue developing.

Good luck kings
